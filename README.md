#### Financial Transactions Data Analysis – Power BI Project

 **Project Overview**

This Power BI project analyzes a Financial Transactions Dataset to provide actionable insights into customer activity, transaction performance, and branch operations.
The dashboard helps visualize transaction trends, monitor failures and pending transactions, and identify top-performing branches and account types.

**Columns in the dataset:**

- Transaction ID – Unique transaction reference
- Customer Name – Name of the account holder
- Account Type – Savings, Current, or other account categories
- Transaction Date – Date the transaction occurred
- Transaction Amount – Value of the transaction
- Branch – Branch handling the transaction
- Status – Transaction outcome (Completed / Pending / Failed)

**Created Columns in Power BI:**

- Pending Transaction –  count of pending transactions
- Completed Transaction –  count of completed transactions
- Failed Transaction –  count of failed transactions

 **Analysis Questions Covered**

1. **Sum of Transaction Amount by Account** – Identify accounts with the highest total transactions.
2. **Sum of Transaction Amount by Branch** – Compare branch transaction volumes.
3. **Sum of Transaction Amount by Account Type** – Understand customer account preferences.
4. **Count of Failed Transactions by Branch** – Monitor failure trends per branch.
5. **Average Transaction Amount by Branch** – Measure average transaction sizes.

10. **Highest Deposit** – Identify the single largest transaction amount.
